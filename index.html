<font size=3>Welcome to my homepage! I'm Yanwei Li, a master student studying in Institue of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
My research interest mainly focus on Compter vision and Artificial Intelligence. In details, I'm delving into Network Architecture Search (NAS) and 
Visual Segmentation, which have the promise to be the generic framework for the efficient network design. 
Currently, I'm working with a group of geniuses in Megvii(Face++) Research. More information please refer to About Me and Publication.
I'm looking for a Ph.D. program (admission in 2020). Please contact me if you have some interest.</font>
