            <b>Welcome to my homepage!</b><br/>
            I'm Yanwei Li, a master student studying in <b>Institue of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</b>
            My research interest mainly focus on Compter vision and Artificial Intelligence. In details, I'm delving into <i>Network Architecture Search (NAS)</i>
            and <i>Visual Segmentation</i>, which have the promise to be the generic framework for the efficient network design. 
            Currently, I'm working with a group of geniuses in <b>Megvii(Face++) Research</b>. More information please refer to About Me and Publication.
